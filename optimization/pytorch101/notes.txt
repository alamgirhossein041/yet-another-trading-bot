learn
    1. forwart pass 
    2. backward pass 
    3. back propagation 
    4. x.backward() , requires_grad()
        requires_Grad=True -> flag for making pytorch able to calculate gradients 
        x.backward() -> calculates gradient of your tensor 
        x.detach() / x.requires_grad(False) -> detaching the gradient computation 
        x.grad.zero_() -> zeroeing gradient tensor 
    5. jacobian product / chain rule 
    6. during training steps you have to clear weights grad !!
